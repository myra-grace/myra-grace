### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer eager to learn and adapt to this fast paced industry. Coming from an applied human sciences background, I intend to weave human sciences with computer sciences. With technology becoming a part of every aspect of life, I want to contribute to this integral shift in our society.
